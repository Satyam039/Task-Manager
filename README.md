# Task-Manager
I've been working on this project using Node.js, JavaScript, Express.js, and EJS. Task Maker is designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks and boost productivity.
Technologies Used:
Node.js: For the backend server
Express.js: As the web application framework
JavaScript: For both frontend and backend logic
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): For templating and rendering dynamic content
